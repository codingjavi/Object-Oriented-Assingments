# Object-Oriented-Assingments
These assingments done in Java and C++ helped me better understand the concepts of Object Oriented Programming. They start fairly easy and get harder towards the end. Java project are P01 - P07 and C++ projects are P08 - P11.

## Other Features
- We also did an assingment on Threads in P07
- Utilized makefiles for C++ projects
- Utilzed build.xml for Java projects
- Used Javadoc for documentation (which explains the large ammount of HTML)
